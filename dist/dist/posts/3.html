I went because a friend dragged me there and I figured free pizza and a weekend of coding sounded better than whatever else I had going on. We ended up winning. Then it happened again. And again. Five times total now.</p><p>People keep asking me what the trick is. There is no trick. But there is a pattern, and after five of these things I think I&#39;ve finally figured out what it actually looks like.</p><h2>The Framework (that I didn&#39;t mean to build)</h2><p>Every winning project I&#39;ve been part of nailed four things. I drew this out on a napkin at 3am during HackMIT and it&#39;s been stuck in my head ever since:</p><pre><code class="language-">          +-------------------+

          | (Why should they  |
          |  care RIGHT NOW)  |
          +-------------------+</code></pre><p>Let me break each of these down with actual examples.</p><h2>Technical Depth — Can you actually build it?</h2><p>This is the foundation. If your team can&#39;t execute, nothing else matters. But here&#39;s the thing — technical depth doesn&#39;t mean complexity. It means competence. Judges can tell the difference between a team that chose the right tool for the job and a team that threw every buzzword at the wall.</p><p>When we built <a href="https://github.com/MuuSeoTia/carbon-advisor" target="_blank">Sustainable AF</a> at HackHarvard, we used GCP, React, TypeScript, Python, and ML models. That sounds like a lot but every piece had a clear reason to exist. The ML model powered the sustainability scoring. GCP handled the solar heat map data. React made the frontend interactive. Nothing was there for show.</p><h2>Scope — Less is more (seriously)</h2><p>This is the one everyone gets wrong. You have 24-48 hours. You are not building a startup. You are building a proof of concept that works flawlessly for a 3-minute demo. <a href="https://github.com/Zapaway/maritime" target="_blank">Maritime</a> won because we did one thing — track ocean microplastics and identify waste with a CNN — and we did it really well. The app loaded fast, the model was accurate, the UX was clean. We could have added ten more features but we didn&#39;t.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen teams with better ideas lose because they tried to build too much and their demo crashed. Scope ruthlessly. Kill your darlings. Ship the thing that works.</p><h2>Pitch — Tell the story</h2><p>Judges don&#39;t remember feature lists. They remember stories. When we presented <a href="https://github.com/ChittebbayiPenugonda/MacroNet" target="_blank">OracleNet</a> — a global knowledge graph that shows cascading impacts of hypothetical events — we didn&#39;t lead with &quot;we used Graph Neural Networks.&quot; We led with &quot;what happens to the global economy if a major shipping route gets blocked tomorrow?&quot; Then we showed it. The GNN was the how, not the what.</p><p>Structure your pitch like a story: problem, why it matters, what you built, how it works, what&#39;s next. In that order. Every time.</p><h2>Demo — Make it work. Period.</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Tetraslam/hackmit25" target="_blank">Griddy</a> at HackMIT was our cleanest execution. Smart grid power management with real-time load balancing over WebSockets. When we demoed, the system handled live load without a hiccup. The judges could see the data flowing. They could interact with it. Nothing was mocked, nothing was hardcoded.</p><p>If your demo doesn&#39;t work live, none of the above matters. Spend the last two hours before judging just testing. Then test again. Then one more time.</p><h2>The X-Factor — Why should they care RIGHT NOW?</h2><p>This is the secret fifth element. Every winning project we built addressed something timely. Sustainability when climate legislation was in the news. Ocean microplastics when there was a viral documentary about it. Smart grid optimization when energy costs were spiking. It&#39;s not manipulation — it&#39;s relevance.</p><p>If your project solves a problem that&#39;s currently in the cultural conversation, judges connect with it on a gut level before you even explain the technical details.</p><h2>One more thing</h2><p>None of this works without the right team. My best projects came from teams where everyone knew their role and trusted each other. No ego, no politics, just building. I&#39;m grateful for every person I&#39;ve stayed up until 4am with over stale Red Bull and questionable WiFi. These wins belong to all of us.</p><p>If you&#39;re reading this before a hackathon — good luck. Scope small, demo hard, tell a story.</p></article></main><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"><p>Built with <a href="https://github.com/MuuSeoTia/Blog-DSL" target="_blank">my Haskell DSL</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
