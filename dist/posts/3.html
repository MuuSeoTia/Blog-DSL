At the time, my family didn&#39;t really have enough money to get by without me constantly working part time, so I would compete in algorithm-based competitions for both college applications and a form of income since I quickly began gaining traction and winning multiple state and regional level events.</p><p>As with everything I usually do, I gradually grew tired of solving repetitive algorithms and distinct assigned tasks and wanted something more freeform and creative. I started attending 4-8 hour &quot;Programming Project&quot; competitions which completely invigorated me. Everyone around me seemed so ambitious and passionate about the projects they&#39;d built, everything from a Chrome dinosaur game replica with a wallaby as a replacement, to an AP Chem interactive virtual lab. From then on I knew I wanted to compete at more hackathons and see what people would come up with.</p><h2>Succeeding in hackathons?</h2><p>After winning five international level hackathons spanning thousands of competitors and placing in sponsor prizes and runner-up categories at dozens of others, I became the <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/mouad-tiahi-started-coding-on-a-decades-old-computer-now-hes-a-2025-top-50-hacker/" target="_blank">first Northeastern student ranked in the MLH Top 50</a>. I consider myself to be one of the most successful hackers still competing, and that is an honor I attribute mainly to the friends who joined me throughout my hackathon journey. I genuinely could not have accomplished anything without their support.</p><p>As a result of this, many always ask me for assistance in hackathons, ideation, and judging. For the rest of this blog I&#39;ll be giving insight into the hackathon &quot;meta&quot; and how to win large-scale hackathons with 1000+ hackers. I&#39;ll cover this in order of most to least important: the idea, pitching and judging, project structure, and lastly team dynamics.</p><h2>Ideation</h2><p>Many tech influencers and LinkedIn officers will likely tell you something along the lines of:</p><pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Solve a real world problem!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Incorporate a billion AI Agents!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Pump out dashboards!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;IMPORT &lt;free_sponsor_api_key&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, they are correct. This is typically the most effective tactic to win any prize at a smaller scale hackathon.</p><p>However, if you actually want to win 1st place in track or general at the most competitive hackathons in the world, or if you want to build something with actual long-term impact and scale, this won&#39;t cut it.</p><p>So how do we start? Throughout my hackathon experience, my teams and I have come up with ideas from as long as 4 months before, up to 14 hours into a hackathon. As a result, I&#39;ve found the best way to get an idea is through the intersection of three main components: Problem, Solution, and Technicality, plus an additional component I call the X-Factor.</p><pre><code class="language-">      PROBLEM           SOLUTION
          \                 /
           \               /
          +-------+-------+
          | WINNING IDEA  |
          +-------+-------+
           /               \
          /                 \
   TECHNICALITY         X-FACTOR</code></pre><h2>The Problem</h2><p>Defining the problem is mainly about deciding whether or not your idea is actually something worth solving. Judges at top hackathons have seen hundreds of projects. They can smell a forced problem statement from across the room. The problem needs to be real. Not &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if&quot; but &quot;this genuinely affects people and here&#39;s why.&quot;</p><p>When we built <a href="https://github.com/MuuSeoTia/carbon-advisor" target="_blank">Sustainable AF</a> at HackHarvard, the problem was clear: consumers want to make sustainable choices but have no practical way to evaluate the environmental impact of their purchases. That&#39;s a real pain point. No stretching required.</p><h2>The Solution</h2><p>Your solution needs to be specific and scoped. This is where most teams lose. They define a vague problem, then propose an equally vague solution. &quot;We&#39;re going to fix climate change&quot; is not a solution. &quot;We built an interactive solar heat map that shows you exactly how much energy your roof can generate&quot; is.</p><p>With <a href="https://github.com/Zapaway/maritime" target="_blank">Maritime</a> the solution was dead simple: point your camera at ocean waste, get an instant CNN classification, and see live microplastic concentration data for your location. One sentence. That&#39;s what you&#39;re aiming for.</p><h2>Technicality</h2><p>This is where your engineering chops matter. The technicality isn&#39;t about using the most buzzwords. It&#39;s about choosing the right stack for the problem and executing it well. Judges can tell the difference between a team that understood their architecture and a team that copy-pasted a tutorial.</p><p>For <a href="https://github.com/ChittebbayiPenugonda/MacroNet" target="_blank">OracleNet</a> we used Graph Neural Networks to model cascading economic impacts. That sounds fancy, but it was the natural choice. You&#39;re modeling a network of dependencies, so a graph-based approach is the obvious architecture. Every technical decision should have a reason.</p><h2>The X-Factor</h2><p>This is the secret sauce. The X-Factor is timing and relevance. Why should judges care about this problem right now? Sustainability when climate legislation is in the news. Ocean microplastics when a documentary goes viral. Smart grid optimization when energy costs are spiking. It&#39;s not manipulation. It&#39;s relevance. If your project solves a problem that&#39;s currently in the cultural conversation, judges connect with it on a gut level before you even open your mouth.</p><h2>Pitching &amp; Judging</h2><p>Once you have a winning idea, you need to sell it. I&#39;ve seen technically superior projects lose to teams with half the engineering but twice the storytelling. Here&#39;s the structure that has never failed me:</p><ul><li>Lead with the problem. Make them feel it.</li><li>Show the solution. Demo first, explain second.</li><li>Explain the technicality. Briefly, confidently.</li><li>End with the X-Factor. Why this matters right now.</li></ul><p>Judges don&#39;t remember feature lists. They remember stories. When we presented <a href="https://github.com/ChittebbayiPenugonda/MacroNet" target="_blank">OracleNet</a>, we didn&#39;t lead with &quot;we used Graph Neural Networks.&quot; We led with &quot;what happens to the global economy if a major shipping route gets blocked tomorrow?&quot; Then we showed it. The GNN was the how, not the what.</p><p>Also, and I cannot stress this enough, if your demo doesn&#39;t work live, none of the above matters. Spend the last two hours before judging just testing. Then test again. Then one more time.</p><h2>Project Structure</h2><p>Planning your project structure is about scope management. You have 24-48 hours. You are not building a startup. You are building a proof of concept that works flawlessly for a 3-minute demo.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I do: in the first hour, whiteboard the entire system. Every API call, every component, every data flow. Assign ownership. Then cut 40% of it. Whatever you think you can build in 24 hours, you can build about 60% of it. Scope ruthlessly. Kill your darlings. Ship the thing that works. <a href="https://github.com/Tetraslam/hackmit25" target="_blank">Griddy</a> at <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/khoury-undergrads-win-three-categories-at-prestigious-mit-hackathon/" target="_blank">HackMIT</a> was our cleanest execution because we planned it this way from the start.</p><h2>Your Team</h2><p>None of this works without the right team. My best projects came from teams where everyone knew their role and trusted each other. No ego, no politics, just building.</p><p>The most important thing isn&#39;t individual skill. It&#39;s complementary skill sets and mutual trust. You need someone who can build the backend, someone who can make the frontend not look terrible, and someone who can pitch. If one person can do two of those, you&#39;re golden.</p><p>I&#39;m grateful for every person I&#39;ve stayed up until 4am with over stale Red Bull and questionable WiFi. If you&#39;re reading this before a hackathon, good luck. Scope small, demo hard, tell a story.</p></article></main><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"><p>Built with <a href="https://github.com/MuuSeoTia/Blog-DSL" target="_blank">my Haskell DSL</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
